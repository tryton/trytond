=============================
Configuration file for Tryton
=============================

The configuration file controls some aspects of the behavior of Tryton.
The file uses a simple ini-file format. It consists of sections, led by a
``[section]`` header and followed by ``name = value`` entries:

.. highlight:: ini

::

    [database]
    uri = postgresql://user:password@localhost/
    path = /var/lib/trytond

For more information see ConfigParser_.

.. _ConfigParser: http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html

The default value of any option can be changed using environment variables
with names using this syntax: ``TRYTOND_<SECTION>__<NAME>``.

Sections
========

This section describes the different main sections that may appear in a Tryton
configuration file, the purpose of each section, its possible keys, and their
possible values.
Some modules could request the usage of other sections for which the guideline
asks them to be named like their module.

The typical form is:

    database://username:password@host:port/?param1=value1&param2=value2

The parameters are database dependent, check the database documentation for a
list of valid parameters.

Default: The value of the environment variable ``TRYTOND_DATABASE_URI`` or

The available databases are:

PostgreSQL
**********

``psycopg2`` supports two type of connections:

    - Unix domain connection: ``postgresql://username:password@/``

Please refer to `psycopg2 for the complete specification of the URI
<https://www.psycopg.org/docs/module.html#psycopg2.connect>`_.

A list of parameters supported by PostgreSQL can be found in the
`documentation
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS>`__.

SQLite
******

The URI is defined as ``sqlite://``

If the name of the database is ``:memory:``, the parameter ``mode`` will be set
to ``memory`` thus using a pure in-memory database.

The recognized query parameters can be found in SQLite's
`documentation
<https://www.sqlite.org/uri.html#recognized_query_parameters>`__.

The uri accepts the following additional parameters:

* ``local_hostname``: used as FQDN of the local host in the HELO/EHLO commands,
  if omited it will use the value of ``socket.getfqdn()``.

session
-------

authentications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comma separated list of the authentication methods to try when attempting to
verify a user's identity. Each method is tried in turn, following the order of
the list, until one succeeds. In order to allow `multi-factor authentication`_,
individual methods can be combined together using a plus (``+``) symbol.

Example::

    authentications = password+sms,ldap

Each combined method can have options to skip them if they are met except for
the first method.
They are defined by appending their name to the method name after a question
mark (``?``) and separated by colons (``:``).

Example::

   authentications = password+sms?ip_address:device_cookie


By default, Tryton only supports the ``password`` method.  This method compares
the password entered by the user against a stored hash of the user's password.
By default, Tryton supports the ``ip_address`` and ``device_cookie`` options.
The ``ip_address`` compares the client IP address with the known network list
defined in `authentication_ip_network`_.
The ``device_cookie`` checks the client device is a known device of the user.
Other modules can define additional authentication methods and options, please
refer to their documentation for more information.

Default: ``password``

``Too Many Requests`` for any other attempts. The counting is done on all
attempts over a period of ``timeout``.

Default: ``5``

max_attempt_ip_network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maximum authentication attempt from the same network before the server
answers unconditionally ``Too Many Requests`` for any other attempts. The
counting is done on all attempts over a period of ``timeout``.

Default: ``300``

ip_network_4
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network prefix to apply on IPv4 address for counting the authentication
attempts.

Default: ``32``
