Views
=====

The views are used to display records of an :class:`ModelView
<trytond.model.ModelView>` to the user.

In Tryton, :class:`ModelView <trytond.model.ModelView>` can have several views.
An `action` opens a window and defines which view to show.

The views are built from XML that is stored in the `view` directory of the
module or in the databases thanks to the model ir.ui.view.

So generally, they are defined in xml files with this kind of xml where name is
the name of the XML file in the `view` directory:

.. highlight:: xml

::

  <record model="ir.ui.view" id="view_id">
      <field name="model">model name</field>
      <field name="type">type name</field>
      <!--field name="inherit" ref="inherit_view_id"/-->
      <!--field name="field_childs">field name</field-->
      <field name="name">view_name</field>
  </record>


There are five types of views:

    * Form

    * Tree

    * Graph

    * Board

    * Calendar

Form view
=========

The RNG describing the xml of a form view is stored in trytond/ir/ui/form.rng.
There is also a RNC in trytond/ir/ui/form.rnc.

A form view is used to display one record of an object.

Elements of the view are put on the screen following the rules:

    * Elements are placed on the screen from left to right, from top to bottom,
      according to the order of the xml.

    * The screen composed of a table with a fixed number of columns and enough
      rows to handle all elements.

    * Elements take one or more columns when they are put in the table. If
      there are not enough free columns on the current row, the elements are put
      at the beginning of the next row.
