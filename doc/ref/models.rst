   matches at least one element.

   .. note::

      The ``view_id`` is set to the
      :attr:`~trytond.transaction.Transaction.context` when this method is
      called.

   The dictionary is composed of the fields as key and their values.

   ``fields_names`` can contain dereferenced fields from related models.
   Their values will be returned under the referencing field suffixed by a
   ``.``.
   The number of *dots* in the name is not limited.

   The virtual fields ``_write`` and ``_delete`` can be used the read the

   empty for a default order.
   This second element may contain ``NULLS FIRST`` or ``NULLS LAST`` to sort

   If neither is specified the default behavior of the backend is used.

   In case the field used is a :class:`~fields.Many2One`, it is also possible
   to use the dotted notation to sort on a specific field from the target
   record.
   Or for a :class:`~fields.Dict` field, the dotted notation is used to sort on
   the key's value.

   method on the field that returns the descriptor.

.. classmethod:: ModelStorage.export_data_domain(domain, fields_names[, offset[, limit[, order[, header]]]])

Instance methods:

.. method:: MultiValueMixin.multivalue_records(field)

   Return the list of all :class:`ValueMixin` records linked to the instance.

   By default, it returns the value of the first found
   :class:`~fields.One2Many` linked to the multivalue model or all the records
   of this one.

.. method:: MultiValueMixin.multivalue_record(field, \*\*pattern)

   Return a new record of :class:`ValueMixin` linked to the instance.

.. method:: MultiValueMixin.get_multivalue(name, \*\*pattern)

   Return the value of the field ``name`` for the pattern.

.. method:: MultiValueMixin.set_multivalue(name, value[, save], \*\*pattern)

   Store the value of the field ``name`` for the pattern.

   If ``save`` is true, it will be stored in the database, otherwise the
   modified :class:`ValueMixin` records are returned unsaved.
   ``save`` is true by default.

.. warning::
    To customize the pattern, both methods must be override the same way.
