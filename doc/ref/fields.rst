Field
=====

.. class:: Field

Fields define the behavior of the data on model's record.

The following attributes are available to all field types.
All are optional except :attr:`~Field.string`.

.. attribute:: Field.string

   A string for the label of the field.

.. attribute:: Field.help

   A multi-line help string for the field.

.. attribute:: Field.required

   If ``True``, the field is not allowed to be empty.
   Default is ``False``.

.. attribute:: Field.readonly

   If ``True``, the field is not editable in the client.
   Default is ``False``.

   .. warning::
      For relational fields, it means only the new, delete, add and remove
      buttons are inactivated.
      The editable state of the target record must be managed at the target
      model level.

.. attribute:: Field.domain

   A :ref:`domain <topics-domain>` constraint that is applied on the field
   value.

   .. note::

      For :class:`Reference` field it is a dictionary that contains the domain
      per model name.

.. attribute:: Field.states

   A dictionary that defines dynamic states of the field and overrides the
   static one.

   Possible keys are ``required``, ``readonly`` and ``invisible``.
   The values are :class:`~trytond.pyson.PYSON` statements that is evaluated
   with the values of the record.

.. attribute:: Field.on_change

   A set of field names.

   If this attribute is set, the client calls the method ``on_change_<field
   name>`` of the model when the user changes the current field value and will
   give the values of each fields in this list.

   The method signature is::

      on_change_<field name>()

   This method must change the value of the fields to be updated.

   .. note::

      The on_change_<field name> methods are running in a readonly transaction.

   The set of field names is filled by using the decorator :meth:`depends`.

.. attribute:: Field.on_change_with

   A set of field names.

   Same as :attr:`on_change`, but defined the other way around.
   If this attribute is set, the client will call the method
   ``on_change_with_<field name>`` of the model when the user changes one of
   the fields defined in the list and will give the values of each fields in
   this list.

   The method signature is::

      on_change_with_<field name>()

   This method must return the new value of the field.

   .. note::

      The on_change_with_<field name> methods are running in a readonly
      transaction.

   The set of field names is filled by using the decorator :meth:`depends`.

.. attribute:: Field.depends

   A :py:class:`set` of extra field names on which the field depends.

   This means that the client read also these fields even if they are not
   defined on the view.
   :attr:`Field.depends` is used for example to ensure that
   :class:`~trytond.pyson.PYSON` statement could be evaluated.

.. attribute:: Field.display_depends

   A computed set of field names on which the field depends when being
   displayed in a read only view.

.. attribute:: Field.edition_depends

   A computed set of field names on which the field depends when being
   displayed in a writable view.

.. attribute:: Field.validation_depends

   A computed set of field names on which the field depends when being
   validated.

.. attribute:: Field.context

   A dictionary which updates the current context for *relation field*.

   .. warning::

      The context could only depend on direct field of the record and without
      context.

.. attribute:: Field.loading

   Define how the field must be loaded: ``lazy`` or ``eager``.

.. attribute:: Field.name

   The name of the field.

Instance methods:

.. method:: Field.convert_domain(domain, tables, Model)

    Convert the simple :ref:`domain <topics-domain>` clause into a SQL
    expression or a new domain.
    :ref:`tables <ref-tables>` could be updated to add new joins.

.. method:: Field.sql_format(value)

    Convert the value to use as parameter of SQL queries.

.. method:: Field.sql_type()

    Return the namedtuple('SQLType', 'base type') which defines the SQL type to
    use for definition and casting.
    Or ``None`` if the field is not stored in the database.

    sql_type is using the ``_sql_type`` attribute to compute its return value.
    The backend is responsible for the computation.

    For the list of supported types by Tryton see :ref:`backend types
    <topics-backend_types>`.

.. method:: Field.sql_cast(expression)

    Return the SQL expression with cast with the type of the field.

.. method:: Field.sql_column(table)

    Return the Column instance based on table.

.. method:: Field.set_rpc(model)

    Add to :class:`model <trytond.model.Model>` the default
    :class:`~trytond.rpc.RPC` instances needed by the field.

.. method:: Field.definition(model, language)

    Return a dictionary with the definition of the field.

.. method:: Field.definition_translations(model, language)

    Return a list of translation sources used by :meth:`~Field.definition`.

Default value
=============

See :ref:`default value <topics-fields_default_value>`

Searching
=========

A class method could be defined for each field which must return a SQL
expression for the given domain instead of the default one.
The method signature is::

    domain_<field name>(domain, tables)

Where ``domain`` is the simple :ref:`domain <topics-domain>` clause and
``tables`` is a nested dictionary, see :ref:`tables <ref-tables>`.

Ordering
========

A class method could be defined for each field which must return a list of SQL
expression on which to order instead of the field.
The method signature is::

    order_<field name>(tables)

Where ``tables`` is a nested dictionary, see :ref:`tables <ref-tables>`.

Depends
=======

.. method:: depends([\*fields[, methods]])

   A decorator to define the field names on which the decorated method depends.

   The ``methods`` argument can be used to duplicate the field names from other
   decorated methods.
   This is useful if the decorated method calls another method.

   Search by similarity is used for the ``ilike`` operator and
   :meth:`~trytond.tools.is_full_text` value if the backend supports it and a
   threshold is set.
   The similarity threshold is defined for the context key ``<model
   name>.<field name>.search_similarity`` or ``search_similarity``.

   The field is ordered using the similarity with the context value from the
   key ``<model name>.<field name>.order`` if it is set.

:class:`Char` has some extra arguments:

.. attribute:: Char.size

   The maximum length (in characters) of the field. The size is enforced at the
   storage level and in the client input.
   The value can be a :class:`~trytond.pyson.PYSON` statement.

.. attribute:: Char.translate

   If ``True``, the value of the field is translatable.
   The value readed and stored will depend on the ``language`` defined in the
   context.

.. attribute:: Char.strip

   If ``True``, leading and trailing whitespace are removed.
   If ``leading``, leading whitespace are removed.
   If ``trailing``, trailing whitespace are removed.
   The default value is ``True``.

.. attribute:: Char.autocomplete

   A set of field names.

   If this attribute is set, the client calls the method ``autocomplete_<field
   name>`` of the :class:`model <trytond.model.Model>` when the user changes
   one of those field values.
   The method signature is::

      autocomplete_<field name>()

   This method must return a list of string that is used by the client to make
   autocompletion proposal.
   The set of field names could be filled by using the decorator :meth:`depends`.

.. attribute:: Char.search_unaccented

   If this attribute is set to ``True``, ``ilike`` searches is performed on
   unaccented strings.

.. attribute:: Char.search_full_text

   If this attribute is set to ``True``, ``ilike`` searches with an
   :meth:`~trytond.tools.is_full_text` value use the full text search of the
   backend.
   The default value is ``False``.

   The context can be used to force the full text search behaviour.
   This is done using the key ``<model name>.<field name>.search_full_text``.
   If ``True``, the full text search is used no matter what the value.
   If ``False``, no full text search is peformed.

   The full text ranking value is added to the similarity if the
   ``search_full_text`` is ``True``.

   If this attribute is set, the client calls the ``selection`` method of
   the model when the user changes on of the fields defined in the list and
   gives the values of each fields in the list.

   The ``selection`` method should be an instance method.

   The set of field names is filled by using the decorator :meth:`depends`.

      It is on the relation_name :class:`~trytond.model.Model` that the unicity
      of the couple (origin, target) must be checked.

   A :py:class:`integer <int>` as :attr:`~trytond.model.Model.id` is used for
   low level APIs.

:class:`One2One` has some extra arguments:

.. attribute:: One2One.datetime_field

   Same as :attr:`Many2One.datetime_field`.

.. attribute:: One2One.filter

   Same as :attr:`One2Many.filter`.

Instance methods:

.. method:: One2One.get_relation()

   Return the relation :class:`~trytond.model.Model`.

.. method:: One2One.get_target()

   Return the target :class:`~trytond.model.Model`.


Function
--------

.. class:: Function(field, getter[, setter[, searcher[, getter_with_context]]])

   A function field can emulate any other given :class:`field <Field>`.

:class:`Function` has some extra arguments:

.. attribute:: Function.getter

   The name of the classmethod or instance of the :class:`~trytond.model.Model`
   for getting values.
   The signature of the classmethod is::

      getter(instances, name)

   where ``name`` is the name of the field, and it must return a dictionary
   with a value for each instance.

   Or the signature of the classmethod is::

      getter(instances, names)

   where ``names`` is a list of name fields, and it must return a dictionary
   containing for each names a dictionary with a value for each instance.

   The signature of the instancemethod is::

      getter(name)

   where ``name`` is the name of the field, and it must return the value.

.. attribute:: Function.setter

   The name of the classmethod of the :class:`~trytond.model.Model` to set the
   value.
   The signature of the method id::

      setter(instances, name, value)

   where ``name`` is the name of the field and ``value`` the value to set.

   .. warning::

       The modifications made to instances are not saved automatically.

.. attribute:: Function.searcher

   The name of the classmethod of the :class:`~trytond.model.Model` to search
   on the field.
   The signature of the method is::

      searcher(name, clause)

   where ``name`` is the name of the field and ``clause`` is a :ref:`domain
   clause <topics-domain>`.
   It must return a list of :ref:`domain <topics-domain>` clauses but the
   ``operand`` can be a SQL query.

.. attribute:: Function.getter_with_context

   A boolean telling if the getter result depends on the context.

   If it does not depend, the getter is called without context and the result
   is stored in the transaction cache when readonly.

   The default value is ``True``.

Instance methods:

.. method:: Function.get(ids, model, name[, values])

   Call the :attr:`~Function.getter` classmethod where ``model`` is the
   :class:`~trytond.model.Model` instance of the field, ``name`` is the name of
   the field.

.. method:: Function.set(ids, model, name, value)

   Call the :attr:`~Function.setter` classmethod where ``model`` is the
   :class:`~trytond.model.Model` instance of the field, ``name`` is the name of
   the field, ``value`` is the value to set.

.. method:: Function.search(model, name, clause)

   Call the :attr:`~Function.searcher` classmethod where ``model`` is the
   :class:`~trytond.model.Model` instance of the field, ``name`` is the name of
   the field, ``clause`` is a clause of :ref:`domain <topics-domain>`.

MultiValue
----------

.. class:: MultiValue(field)

   A multivalue field that is like a :class:`Function` field but with
   predefined :attr:`~Function.getter` and :attr:`~Function.setter` that use
   the :class:`~trytond.model.MultiValueMixin` for stored values.

.. warning::

   The :meth:`~trytond.model.MultiValueMixin.get_multivalue` and
   :meth:`~trytond.model.MultiValueMixin.set_multivalue` should be prefered
   over the descriptors of the field.

.. warning::

   The :ref:`default <topics-fields_default_value>` method of the field must
   accept pattern as keyword argument.


Dict
----

.. class:: Dict(schema_model[, \**options])

   A :py:class:`dictionary <dict>` field with predefined keys.

.. note::
    It is possible to store the dict as JSON in the database if the backend
    supports by manually altering the column type to JSON on the database.

:class:`Dict` has some extra arguments:

.. attribute:: Dict.schema_model

   The name of the :class:`~trytond.model.DictSchemaMixin` model that stores
   the definition of keys.

.. attribute:: Dict.search_unaccented

   Same as :attr:`Char.search_unaccented` but when searching on key's value.

Instance methods:

.. method:: Dict.translated([name[, type_]])

   Return a descriptor for the translated ``values`` or ``keys`` of the field
   following ``type_``.
   The descriptor must be used on the same class as the field.
   Default ``type_`` is ``values``.
